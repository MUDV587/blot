# blot

A minimal UI in Unity for @inkle's Ink language (https://github.com/inkle/ink).
Drag-and-drop the script into an existing Unity project and give it a Canvas
and some UI prefabs to work with; it will automatically handle the story flow
and update the options on screen.

It's (intentionally) very low-fi - I just wanted the bare minimum I could get
by with and still have a functioning UI - which means text will go off the 
screen and isn't laid out sensibly. Hopefully it's enough for people to get
started playing with Ink, though!
