# blot

A minimal UI in Unity for [inkle](http://www.inklestudios.com/)'s 
[Ink language](https://github.com/inkle/ink). Drag-and-drop the script into an
existing Unity project and give it a Canvas and some UI prefabs to work with;
it will automatically handle the story flow and update the options on screen.

It's (intentionally) very low-fi - I just wanted the bare minimum I could get
by with and still have a functioning UI - which means text will go off the 
screen and isn't laid out sensibly. Hopefully it's enough for people to get
started playing with Ink, though!

If you don't have any interest in fiddling around with the UI elements 
themselves, then you should be able to just load Blot-Sample and replace 
`story.ink.json` with another compiled `.json` story from Ink; for instructions
on how to do that, check the Ink repo.
